# 3D Airplane Simulation – Computer Graphics Project

An interactive 3D simulation of an airplane flying through a virtual environment, built using OpenGL and GLUT. The project demonstrates key concepts of computer graphics, including lighting, materials, object transformations, and camera movement.

## Features
- 3D airplane model with detailed body, wings, and boosters
- Moving clouds, sun, and cityscape buildings
- Lighting and material effects for realism
- Camera control using mouse (rotation) and keyboard (airplane movement)
- Real-time animation using GLUT functions

## Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL & GLUT
- 3D transformations
- Lighting & materials

## Files
- `main.cpp`: Full OpenGL source code

## How to Run
1. Rename `Group_4_Code.txt` to `main.cpp`  
2. Compile with an OpenGL/GLUT-supported compiler (e.g., Visual Studio or Code::Blocks with OpenGL libraries)
3. Run the compiled program
4. Use:
   - `f / b / u / d` keys to control airplane (forward, back, up, down)
   - Mouse drag to rotate the camera

## Notes
This project was developed for CS 360 – Computer Graphics as part of course requirements in Princess Nourah University.
